### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an Electrical Engineering graduate with an interest in software development and IoT. An engineer at heart, I love challenges and looking for creative solutions to solve them. I work independently or in a team, am a determined problem-solver with a can-do spirit and never pass up on the chance to learn something new. I believe that technology can be used to improve peopleâ€™s lives, and am excited by the potential of emerging technologies like IoT and machine learning to change the way we work and live.
