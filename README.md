I am an electrical engineering graduate turned software developer with a focus on robust systems and an eye for good design.

An engineer at heart, I enjoy the challenge of looking for creative solutions to complex problems. I work well independently or in a team, and am a determined problem-solver who believes that anything can be solved with time and effort, as well as never passing up on the chance to learn something new.

I believe that technology can be used to better peopleâ€™s lives, and am excited by the potential of emerging technologies such as machine learning and IoT to change the way we work and live.
