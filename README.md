# About Me

As an electrical engineer turned software engineer, my interests lie in delivering software solutions that makes life easier for businesses and end-users. As an aspiring software architect comfortable working across different tech stacks, I actively look for potential business problems that can be solved with software, as well as keep up with trends in the industry.

An engineer at heart, I enjoy the challenge of formulating optimal solutions to complex problems. I work well both independently and in a team, and am a determined problem-solver that never gives up.
