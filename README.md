As a fresh grad electrical engineer turned software engineer, my interests lie in delivering great user experiences through good frontend design. I am fascinated by the ever-changing trends in design and their impact on the user and overall business outcomes.

An engineer at heart, I enjoy the challenge of looking for creative solutions to complex problems. I work well independently or in a team, and am a determined problem-solver who believes that anything can be solved with time and effort, as well as never passing up on the chance to learn something new.
