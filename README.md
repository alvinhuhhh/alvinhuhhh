Fresh grad Electrical Engineer turned Software Developer looking for opportunities to learn
and grow. Tech enthusiast who loves to keep up with the latest technology and design
trends.

An engineer at heart, I enjoy the challenge of looking for creative solutions to complex problems. I work well independently or in a team, and am a determined problem-solver who believes that anything can be solved with time and effort, as well as never passing up on the chance to learn something new.
